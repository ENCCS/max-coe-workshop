SIESTA setup
============

Directory with tutorials
------------------------

For every practical there is a folder in the shared directory
`/leonardo_work/EUHPC_TD02_030/siesta-tutorials` that contains all the files you will need for said practical. At the start of every tutorial, please copy the required files from that shared directory to your scratch folder. For example, for the first tutorial,

$ cd /gpfs/scratch/nct01/<USERNAME> !! MN4 directory, needs to be updated!
$ cp -pr 01-FirstEncounter_I .

Please do NOT copy these files before the start of the practical, in case they are updated shortly before the practical starts.

Note: We will be running everything in the scratch folder, since disk space is limited in $HOME.
